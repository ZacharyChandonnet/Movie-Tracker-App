# FlickFlow

React application made with React.js Tailwind and Lottie animation

 Flickflow is an application with features similar to those of a movie manager: 
 it allows user authentication, adding favorites, the ability to rate a series, and includes a search engine. 
 All the data comes from an external RESTful API.
